// This file reads `managedFields[].fieldsV1` to answer one question: does this
// field manager own the fields a Dorgu remediation would write?
//
// fieldsV1 is a set encoded as nested JSON objects, one key per path segment:
//
//	{"f:spec":{"f:template":{"f:spec":{"f:containers":{
//	   "k:{\"name\":\"report-worker\"}":{"f:resources":{"f:limits":{"f:memory":{}}}}}}}}}
//
// Prefixes: `f:` is a field name, `k:` is an associative-list key (containers
// are keyed by name), `v:` a set member and `i:` a list index. Only `f:` and
// `k:` occur on the path this cares about.
//
// Ported from dorgu-operator internal/workload/ownership_fields.go. See the
// package comment in match.go for why this is a copy rather than an import.

// fieldsV1 path segments down to a container's resource block.

// `spec.replicas` (an autoscaler) or a pod-template annotation (a sidecar
// injector) is not in the way of a resource patch.
